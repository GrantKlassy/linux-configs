# linux-configs
A repo to hold various linux configuration files (bashrc, vimrc) and other useful linux files. Built so that I have an easy way to pull down the configs I want when working on a new machine.

## Usage
To automatically pull down my bashrc and vimrc, you can either run

`wget https://git.io/fNrNn -O /tmp/setup.sh && chmod +x /tmp/setup.sh && /tmp/setup.sh && rm /tmp/setup.sh`

... or if you like to like dangerously ...

`curl -s -L https://git.io/fNrNn | bash`
